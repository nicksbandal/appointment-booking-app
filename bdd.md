**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Prepared By:** Business Analysis Team  
**Project:** Dual-App Clinic Appointment System

---

## Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document outlines the development requirements for a comprehensive clinic appointment booking system consisting of two separate mobile/web applications: a **Patient App** for booking appointments and a **Doctor App** for managing schedules and patient information. The system addresses the critical need for streamlined healthcare appointment management, reducing manual scheduling burdens while improving patient access to healthcare services.

The primary business objective is to develop a user-friendly digital solution that enables patients to book appointments with specific clinics for new consultations or follow-up visits, while providing doctors with efficient tools to manage their schedules, view patient history, and modify appointments. This dual-app approach ensures optimized user experiences tailored to each stakeholder group's specific needs[70][72].
